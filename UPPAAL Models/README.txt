In all models, under System Declarations, switch between synchronous and asynchronous
versions of the RingNodeTemplates, as well as the different Setup Templates.
NOTE: Some queries are dependent on the declared RingNode and/or Setup Templates.

The number of nodes, or any other relevant parameters can be changed in the Global Declaration.


The main model file are: Discovery, FailureDetection, and PlanGeneration.
NOTE: Some model include other RingNode templates than RingNodeSync and RingNodeAsync.
These are merely for demostrating past work and may not be up to date with queries.
